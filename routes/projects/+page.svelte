			<h3>Recommendation System - Recommending best games from user history /Apr, 2022/</h3>
			<p>
				The main goal of this project was to build a recommendation system that builds personalized
				game recommendations for a closed set of users (in this task, we assume that the user
				database will not receive new elements later on). The model built uses Singular Value
				Decomposition (SVD) to achieve the task at hand.

				This project was a test task for my internship in Data Science (added in the next section).
